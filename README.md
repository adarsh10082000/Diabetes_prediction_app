# Diabetes_prediction_app

##Overview
The Diabetes Prediction App is a web-based application built using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of a user having diabetes based on input parameters. The app uses a machine learning model trained on a diabetes dataset and provides an intuitive interface for users to input relevant health metrics.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Simple form-based input for health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
Real-Time Prediction: Provides instant diabetes risk prediction.
Machine Learning Backend: Utilizes a pre-trained classification model for accurate results.
Interactive Visualizations: Displays input data and prediction confidence using charts and graphs.
##Technologies Used
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow (depending on model)
Data: Diabetes dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Database)
